# Exercises_with_APIs - API calls and Data Analysis

Welcome to the "Exercises-with-APIs" repository. Here, you will find exercises that involve making API calls and performing data analysis. If you're interested in practicing, you can explore a list of free and open public APIs with no authentication requirements on [this website](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/).

## [Makeup API Exercise](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/)

For our first exercise, we will be using the [Makeup API](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/). The following methods and attributes are utilized for the API call and transforming the data into a DataFrame:

* `requests.get()`
* `response.status_code`
* `type()`
* `response.json()`
* `pd.DataFrame.from_dict()`

## Data Analysis

We will also perform a basic data analysis on the DataFrame, which includes:

* `df.shape`
* `df.info()`
* `pd.to_numeric()`
* Creating a scatter plot using `df.plot.scatter()`
* Creating a bar graph using `df.plot.bar()`

Please note that the mentioned attributes and methods belong to various Python libraries. You can find detailed information and code examples in the Jupyter notebook provided in this repository.

Thank you for your attention, and enjoy the exercise!
